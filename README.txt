Hi evaluators!

First of all, sorry for the mess.
We've been busy improving our results and this did not really help to keep our codebase clean.
In this repository you'll find our work for the state-farm competition.
In the end we've split up the code into multiple folders, but we didn't check whether it still works.
The contents of these folders are as follows:

- feature_extraction_models: our efforts for training models based on feature extraction methods from the networks
- googlenet: we tried training the googlenet architecture, these files contain those efforts
- inception: "                   " inception ""
- resnet: all our efforts with resnet in lasagne are grouped here; CIFAR based and ResNet 52
- vgg: our efforts concerning VGG based methods are in this folder; VGG16, data augmentation and VGG19


Of course, this final form does not contain all our efforts.
For a full overview of our work we invite you to take a look at the git history of this repository.
So if you want access to this, we'll send you an invite!



Kind regards,
Team Five Nearest Neighbours
