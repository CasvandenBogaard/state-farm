6/17:

on gcn7, we have inceptionv3 train for 6 epochs in the "earlier experiments" setting from the paper .. output: run1. file: InceptionV3_first.py
on gcn28, we have inceptionv3 train for 6 epochs in the "author's best" setting from the paper .. output: run2. file: InceptionV3_best.py

damn it, errors... leaving it rest for now, focus on CADiMI today.
